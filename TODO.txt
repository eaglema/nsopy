# Easy
- test coverage badge
- explain how to use loggers and util to record as csv (utils)
- DONE config __init__.py such that you can do ``from nsopy import UniversalPGM''
- we currently implement max (so we have to supply negative of gradient when we want to min) should probably be fixed (e.g. using adapters)
- more explanations on how to handle equality vs inequality constraints in the basic examples

# Harder / New features
- the default should probably be 'min' not 'max'
- add in MRF example application
- think about an example for structured mrf (not multiple choice)
- create wrapper nsoSolver(method='upgm', stopping=..., )
- use cutting planes or yosida to get a stopping criterion for ALL methods
- replace CP and BDL gurobi dependency with open source alternative?
- works on python 3? travis..
- more test cases
